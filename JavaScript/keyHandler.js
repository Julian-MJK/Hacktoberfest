/** 
 * Summary for using this snippet:
 * 'keys' is an object containing the states of all until-now pressed keys.
 * when a key is pressed, it's name is put into the object and given the value "true".
 * when a key is released, it's given the value "false".
 * The keyboard-keys are stored as object-keys, with the name of the keyboard-key as its name.
 * So "keys.<keyName>" will return true or false depending on if it's pressed.
 * E.g.: "if(keys.shift){ <do stuff> }"
 * directional keys = "arrow"+direction
